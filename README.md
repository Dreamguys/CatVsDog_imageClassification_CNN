# Image Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. The dataset used in this example is the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, which contains labeled images of dogs and cats.

## Project Overview

This project walks through the following steps:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Download the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and batch the images using TensorFlow's image dataset utilities.
3. **Model Creation**: Build a CNN model with multiple convolutional, batch normalization, and pooling layers.
4. **Model Training**: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on validation data.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Kaggle API (for dataset download)

You can install the required packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras kaggle
```

## Usage

1. **Kaggle Setup**: Ensure you have a Kaggle API token (kaggle.json) and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. **Download Dataset**:
   ```bash
   !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
   !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle
   !kaggle datasets download -d salader/dogs-vs-cats
   ```
3. **Extract Dataset**: The dataset will be extracted into the specified directory.
4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the notebook cells to preprocess the data, build, and train the model.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional Layers (Conv2D)
- Batch Normalization Layers
- MaxPooling Layers
- Fully Connected (Dense) Layers
- Dropout Layers

### Model Summary:
- Input Shape: `(256, 256, 3)`
- Output Layer: Single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (Dog/Cat).

## Training

The model is trained for 10 epochs with binary crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer. The training and validation accuracy/loss can be monitored through the training history.

## Results

After training, the model's performance can be evaluated on unseen data to determine its accuracy and effectiveness in classifying dog and cat images.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic example of image classification using CNNs. Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters, increasing dataset size, or using transfer learning techniques.
